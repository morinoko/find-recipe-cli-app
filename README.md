# FindRecipe

This CLI gem helps you get some cooking inspiration directly from your command line! Find a recipe by looking at a list of trending recipes from Cookpad or search with a keyword such as a dish name or ingredient name.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'find_recipe'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install find_recipe

## Usage

Type the below and follow the on screen prompts.

    $ find-recipe

You will be asked whether you want to see the trending recipes list or whether you want to search with a keyword. If you choose to search, enter a dish name or ingredient name to see a list of recipes based on your input.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
